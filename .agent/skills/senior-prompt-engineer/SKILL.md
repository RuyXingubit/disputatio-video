# Senior Prompt Engineer Skill

This skill provides a high-level framework for designing, optimizing, and evaluating LLM-based systems. It focuses on advanced prompting techniques, agentic workflows, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) performance.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Prompt Optimization & Engineering
- **Advanced Patterns**: Systematic application of Chain-of-Thought, ReAct, and Few-Shot prompting.
- **Tools**: Use `scripts/prompt_optimizer.py` to refine and version prompts.
- **Patterns Guide**: Reference `references/prompt_engineering_patterns.md`.

### 2. Agentic System Design
- **Orchestration**: Building multi-agent workflows and autonomous loops.
- **Architectures**: Guidance on tool-use, planning, and self-correction systems.
- **Reference**: See `references/agentic_system_design.md`.

### 3. RAG & LLM Evaluation
- **Retrieval Quality**: Evaluating the precision and recall of RAG pipelines.
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Methodology for benchmarking LLM outputs.
- **Tools**: Use `scripts/rag_evaluator.py` and `scripts/agent_orchestrator.py`.

- [Evaluation Frameworks](file:///Users/ruy/Code/disputatio-video/.agent/skills/senior-prompt-engineer/references/llm_evaluation_frameworks.md)

## Interaction Workflows

### Optimization Cycle
1. Define baseline prompt and success metrics.
2. Run `scripts/prompt_optimizer.py` to generate variations.
3. Use `scripts/rag_evaluator.py` if testing a RAG system.
4. Iterate based on LLM evaluation results.
